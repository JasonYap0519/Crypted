                    Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens. For instance, multicolumn layouts on large screens should be reduced to single column layouts on small screens. You are encouraged to implement separate layouts using CSS media queries.

                    Our site collapses and expands to fit all screen sizes in many areas. The homepage main icons collapse into a column, the preview images also collapse right below those icons, our footer collapses into a column as well as the navbar, the "Learn" pages also do a row -> column change. We have plenty of examples.

                    Our site has a global style rule that is used across all pages. We also have the other page css files split into their own respective files. Some pages overlap, but most are unique per page.
